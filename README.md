# Bluetooth-Transfer

AutoHotKey Script runs a python script after a designated keyboard shortcut
The python script proceeds to use bluetool to disconnect the bluetooth device from the windows device
and sends a post to the Automate for Android api to activate an Automate script on the android device
to attempt a connection to the bluetooth device.
